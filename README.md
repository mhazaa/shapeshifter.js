# shapeshifter.js

Shapeshifter.js takes low poly shapes and transforms them into each other. The shapes don't need to have the same number of polygons. The polygons don't need to have equal number of points. And the polygons can have different colors and opacity.

The only requirement is the the svg you pass has polygons as the child elements. Paths, polylines, and rects won't work.
